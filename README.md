# Tech Mental Health Analysis
## Overview
This project explores mental health perceptions and trends within the technology industry using survey data from the Open Source Mental Illness (OSMI) survey conducted between 2014 and 2019. The analysis aims to understand attitudes, prevalence, and comfort levels regarding mental health issues among employees in the tech sector.

## Dataset Information
The dataset used for this analysis contains three main tables:

**Survey**: Contains information about different surveys conducted each year, including SurveyID and Description.<br>
**Question**: Contains various questions asked in the surveys, identified by QuestionID and QuestionText.<br>
**Answer**: Contains respondent answers to survey questions, linked to SurveyID, QuestionID, and UserID. Also includes AnswerText, indicating responses.<br>
## Analysis Goals
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Identify trends and patterns related to mental health perceptions.
Analyze the frequency and distribution of mental health-related responses.
Examine correlations between different survey questions.
### Visualization:

Visualize trends and distributions using various charts (e.g., bar plots, pie charts, etc.).
Illustrate comfort levels for discussing mental and physical health over the surveyed years.
### Insights and Implications:

Derive insights regarding mental health attitudes and their implications in the tech industry.
Explore the changes in mental health perceptions over the years.
Discuss the significance of these findings for employee well-being and organizational strategies.
### Files and Structure
**data**: Contains the SQLite database file (.sqlite) with the survey data.<br>
**notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.<br>
